## Hi there 👋
## My name is Bryon, I'm starting my journey to become a developer.

## ☕ My first target language is JavaScript, aiming to become a Fullstack/Backend dev.

## I would love any form of insight or direction to reach this goal. 🍻

## If you just want to chat, throw some D&D, video games, or Anime at me. pretty much anything that makes you a dork is good conversation starters.

## If you would like to reach me, send me an email at blueskiebo@gmail.com
